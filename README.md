# Background
W. Avy likes the analysis, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants us to create temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
The new assignment consists of two technical analysis deliverables and a written report. You submited the following:

**Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June.**
-The average temperature is 74.94(F)
-The minimum temperature is 64(F)
-The maximum temperature is 85(F)
-This data has 1700 entries.

**Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December.**
-The average temperature is 71.04(F)
-The minimum temperature is 56 (F)
-The maximum temperature is 83(F)
-This data is has 1517 entries.

## Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis.

**June temperature**
Count of 1700 
Mean of 74.94
Std of 3.26
Min of 64.00
25% of 73.00
50% of 75.00
75% of 77.00
Max of 85.00

**December temperature**
Count of 1517
Mean of 71.04
Std of 3.75
Min of 56.00
25% of 69.00
50% of 71.00
75% of 74.00
Max of 83.00

By looking at the above statistical analysis, we can conclude that there is not a huge difference in the overall statistical analysis for June and December. It indicates that most months of the year, the temperature would be pleasant for people to take advantage of and use the surf shop. Moreover, looking at the high-level summary helped us to decide that opening a new shop in the Oahu, Hawaii location would be a great attraction to the Surfs-Up successful business.
